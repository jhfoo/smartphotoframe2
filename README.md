# smartphotoframe2
This is a complete rewrite from SMARTPhotoFrame, for no good reason other than the desire to learn Vue in the process.

## New Features
The following are new from SMARTPhotoFrame:
- More photos loaded: code now loads up to 100 photos by default
- Material UI (via Vuetify): moving away from Semantic UI (also a good UI framework, but starting show its age) 
- Auto Facebook login: frequent users can load their last selected album with minimal friction
- Debug mode: toggle-able mode to see loads of developer garbage for curious
- Preference: in-browser storage of display behavior
- Auto full screen: browser goes full-screen before photo display begins

## Key tech stack
- [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue)
- [Vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify)
- [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
