# smartphotoframe2
This is a complete rewrite from SMARTPhotoFrame, for no good reason other than the desire to learn Vue in the process.

## New Features
The following are new from SMARTPhotoFrame:
- More photos loaded: code now loads up to 100 photos by default
- Material UI (via Vuetify): moving away from Semantic UI (also a good UI framework, but starting show its age) 
- Auto Facebook login: intent is for frequent users to load their last selected album with minimal friction
- Debug mode: toggle-able mode to see loads of developer garbage for curious

## Key tech stack
- Vue
- Vuetify
- Webpack
